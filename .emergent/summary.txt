**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive, multi-page static React application has been built. It features all user-requested pages, including a fully functional blog, case studies section, careers page, and a new customer experience page. The site's content has been extensively updated to position the agency around predictive intelligence, leveraging a partnership with OSG Analytics and their ASEMAP™ platform. The application uses a sophisticated black and gold theme and is fully responsive. The user has been successfully guided through deploying the site to Vercel and connecting their custom domain.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was tasked with doubling the length of all short blog posts. The agent has modified the content within  to expand the articles.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent should instruct the testing agent to navigate to the /insights page, click on several of the recently expanded blog posts (e.g., The Customer Journey Mapping Mistake), and verify that the expanded content is rendering correctly without layout issues or errors.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   There are no known technical issues or bugs. The previous deployment and GitHub synchronization problems have been resolved.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Verify Expanded Blog Content (P0)**
    -   **Description:** The agent expanded the content for several short blog posts but did not verify the changes on the live site.
    -   **Where to resume:** The code changes are complete in . The next step is to visually verify that the expanded posts render correctly.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the user's request and ensure the blog content is properly formatted and readable.
    -   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **Task 1: Create Our Approach / Why Intelligence Matters Page (P0):** Create a new page dedicated to explaining the intelligence narrative, the OSG partnership, and the Acemap/O360 platforms, as requested in the user's detailed plan. This requires creating a new page component, adding it to the router in , and updating .
    - **Task 2: Enhance All Team Bios (P1):** The user requested that *each* team member's bio on the About page be updated with intelligence context. Currently, only Erania's bio has been updated. This requires editing .
    - **Task 3: Create Reusable Intelligence Advantage Callout (P1):** Develop a reusable React component for the Intelligence Advantage callout and deploy it on the Services, About, and Case Studies pages to ensure consistent messaging.
    - **Task 4: Align Blog Content with User's Plan (P1):** The user provided specific, targeted titles for new blog posts. While new posts were added, they did not match the requested titles. Review the user's request in Chat Message 178 (#14) and create/update blog posts to match the specified topics.
    - **Task 5: Implement Visual Intelligence Badges (P1):** Create simple, visually distinct icon/badges for Stanford-Born AI, 60+ Country Validated, etc., and deploy them site-wide (Homepage, Services, About, Footer) to reinforce differentiators.

- **Future Tasks:**
    - **Task 6: Create Comparison Infographic (P2):** Design a simple, shareable infographic visual comparing a Traditional Fractional Executive with a Brackett Fractional Executive, as specified in the user's plan.
    - **Task 7: Site-wide Micro-copy and CTA Audit (P2):** Perform a full-site review to replace generic terms (market research) with intelligence-focused language (predictive intelligence) and ensure all CTAs are updated as per the user's plan.
    - **Task 8: Final Design Polish & Consistency Check (P2):** Conduct a full-site review to ensure consistent fonts, colors, spacing, and hover effects across all pages.
    - **Task 9: Enhance Contact Page (P2):** The contact page is functional but stylistically basic compared to the rest of the site and could be enhanced.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router (including  for dynamic blog routes and a  component for navigation).
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, lucid-react for icons.
-   **Data:** A single local JavaScript file () serves as a static data store for all blog posts and case studies.
-   **Deployment:** The project is configured for Vercel deployment via a  file in the  directory that handles client-side routing.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (The application is a static site with no database).

**changes in tech stack**
-   N/A

**All files of reference**
-   : Homepage, heavily updated.
-   : Contains signature programs and was updated with new content.
-   : Contains team bios; needs further updates.
-   : New page for case studies.
-   : Main blog page.
-   : CRITICAL - Stores content for all blog articles and case studies. It was recently modified to expand blog content.
-   : New page.
-   : New page.
-   : Contains all application routes.
-   : Contains main navigation links.
-   : Critical for Vercel deployment to handle React Router's client-side routing.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file now contains a significant amount of static data for both blog posts and case studies. While functional, it is becoming unwieldy. Future work could involve splitting this data into a more organized structure (e.g., ) with separate files for blogs and case studies.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your immediate priority is to verify the last task:** The agent expanded blog post content but did not test it. You must verify these changes are rendered correctly before proceeding.
-   **Incomplete User Plan:** The user provided a large, 18-point plan for content updates (Chat Message 178). Many points are still outstanding (see Upcoming Tasks). The highest priority among these is creating the **Our Approach** page.
-   **Deployment is on Vercel:** The user is deploying the site to Vercel and has faced several issues. Be prepared to assist with any further deployment questions. The  file in the  directory is essential.
-   **Data is Static:** All content (blogs, case studies, services) is stored in JavaScript arrays within the React components (primarily , , etc.). There is no backend or database.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    (updated multiple times to reflect project progress)
