<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially wanted to create a cleaner, more business-oriented version of their agency website: .

This evolved into a comprehensive website restructuring based on a detailed guide provided by the user. The key requirements included:
- **PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - A complete overhaul of the website's architecture, navigation, and content.
    - New pages: Home, How We Work, Solutions, Brand & Design, Intelligence, Insights, About, Contact.
    - A new brand identity with the tagline: Intelligence That Executes.
    - Detailed content blueprints for each page, focusing on fractional strategic services, proprietary AI technology, and case studies.
    - Integration of a new design system with a specific color palette (Navy Blue, Refined Gold, Professional Grays) and typography (Inter font).
    - The site should be populated with relevant, professional imagery.
    - The contact form should remain an external JotForm.
    - A core final deliverable is providing instructions on how to embed the React application into the user's Squarespace site.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a fully-restructured, multi-page static React application. It has been built from the ground up based on the user's comprehensive guide. The site reflects the new brand identity, content structure, and a sophisticated, business-friendly design system (navy blue and gold palette). All new pages have been created and populated with the specified text content. The application is purely frontend.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Fulfilling the user's request to add imagery to each page. The agent first confirmed there was no red color to remove (a point of confusion from the user's request). The agent then used the  to gather a collection of professional stock images and began implementing them, starting with the Home page.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N (Testing was performed after the last major redesign, but not yet after starting the image insertion task).
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- There are no outstanding bugs or issues. The previous accessibility concerns were rendered obsolete by the complete website redesign.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Populate All Pages with Imagery (P0)**
  - **Where to resume:** The agent has already selected a set of images and added one to . The next step is to systematically edit the remaining page components (, , , , , ) to include relevant images in their hero sections and other appropriate areas, as per the design.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the visual aspect of the website, making it feel complete and professional, ready for final review.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on something:** Nothing.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **Task 1: Provide Squarespace Deployment Instructions (P0):** This is a critical, unaddressed requirement from the original problem statement. The agent must research and provide clear, step-by-step instructions for the user on how to embed or deploy this React application within their Squarespace site. This may involve using Squarespace's Code Block feature, Developer Mode, or hosting the app externally and embedding it.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Complete Website Restructuring:** Rebuilt the entire website from scratch based on a detailed, multi-page content and architecture guide provided by the user.
- **New Pages Created:**
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
- **Multiple Design System Implementations:**
    - Iteratively applied and refined two complete design systems based on user feedback, including changes to the color palette, typography (from Playfair Display to Inter), and layout styles. The final version uses a navy blue and gold theme.
- **Component Updates:**
    - Updated  and a new  component to match the new site structure.
    - Updated  with the new routing for all pages.
- **Bug & Layout Fixes:**
    - Resolved headline rendering issues (improper line breaks).
    - Fixed text contrast problems (e.g., blue text on dark backgrounds).
    - Removed all placeholder emojis and TM symbols from the content.
- **Testing:** Successfully ran the  after the major restructuring and design updates, achieving a 100% pass rate.
- **PRD Update:** Updated  to reflect the completed restructuring.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. All previously identified issues were resolved during the complete website rebuild.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, React Router
- **Styling:** Global CSS () for variables and base styles, and component-specific styles in . The design uses CSS variables for theming.
- **Architecture:** A static multi-page application with a component-based structure. Pages are distinct components managed by React Router.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (The application is a static site with no database).

**changes in tech stack**
- N/A

**All files of reference**
- : Main application file with routing.
- : Global styles, CSS variables for the color palette, and font imports ().
- : Custom styles for pages and components.
- : The main navigation bar.
- : The site footer.
- All files under : Represent the individual pages of the website.
- : Contains the user's requirements.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The majority of the application's styling is in a single large  file. For better maintainability, these styles should be refactored into component-specific CSS files or a CSS-in-JS solution (like styled-components or CSS Modules).

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The highest priority is to finish the in-progress task of adding images to all pages.
- Immediately after, the agent MUST address the outstanding requirement of providing instructions for deploying the app to Squarespace. This is a crucial final deliverable for the user.
- The user provides very detailed, document-based instructions for changes. The agent should be prepared to parse large amounts of text and implement comprehensive changes.
