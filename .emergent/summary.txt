<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially wanted to create a cleaner, more business-oriented version of their agency website: .

This evolved into a comprehensive website restructuring based on a detailed guide provided by the user. The key requirements included:
- **PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - A complete overhaul of the website's architecture, navigation, and content.
    - New pages: Home, How We Work, Solutions, Brand & Design, Intelligence, Insights, About, Contact.
    - A new brand identity with the tagline: Intelligence That Executes.
    - Detailed content blueprints for each page, focusing on fractional strategic services, proprietary AI technology, and case studies.
    - A new design system with a specific color palette (initially Navy Blue, now Black and Gold) and typography (Inter font).
    - The site should be populated with relevant, professional imagery.
    - The contact form should remain an external JotForm.
    - A core final deliverable is providing instructions on how to embed the React application into the user's Squarespace site.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A multi-page static React application has been built from the ground up, featuring all user-requested pages and content. The design has been iteratively refined into a sophisticated black and gold theme with dynamic elements like animations and hover effects. All pages have been populated with imagery, logos have been updated to SVG format, and branding has been made consistent (e.g., crediting OSG Intelligence). However, the most recent attempt to apply the black color scheme across all pages has broken the application.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Propagating the new black and gold design system (which was finalized on the Home page) to all other pages of the website. This involved find-and-replace operations to change the color scheme from navy blue to black and adjust layouts.
- **Status:** BLOCKED
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing by checking browser console logs first. After the fix, use the Frontend testing agent.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: All pages are rendering blank (P0)**
  - **Description:** After attempting to apply a consistent black theme to all pages, the entire React application started rendering blank pages. This indicates a critical JavaScript runtime error that is preventing any components from mounting.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue:** This is the primary blocker for any further work.
  - **Details:**
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent used  across all page components to replace the navy blue hex code () with black () and update hero section padding. This action is the likely cause of the error.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Use  with  to check for JavaScript errors. An error like X is not defined or a syntax error is highly probable.
        2.  Inspect the frontend supervisor logs for any compilation errors: ==> /var/log/supervisor/frontend.err.log <==

        3.  Carefully review the last  operations (messages 258-260). It's possible an incorrect replacement broke the syntax in one or more files.
        4.  View one of the modified files (e.g., ) to manually check for obvious syntax errors.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Apply Consistent Design to All Pages (P0)**
  - **Description:** Ensure all pages of the website share the same black and gold color scheme, dynamic animations, and layout conventions established on the .
  - **Status:** BLOCKED
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on something:** Yes, blocked by Issue 1: All pages are rendering blank. This task cannot be completed until the site is functional again.
  - **Where to resume:** After fixing the blank page error, systematically verify that each page renders correctly with the intended black background and updated styles.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **Task 1: Provide Squarespace Deployment Instructions (P0):** This is a critical, unaddressed requirement from the original problem statement. The agent must research and provide clear, step-by-step instructions for the user on how to embed or deploy this React application within their Squarespace site. This may involve using Squarespace's Code Block feature, Developer Mode, or hosting the app externally.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Design System Overhaul:** Shifted the primary color from navy blue to black and propagated this change (which led to the current issue).
- **Dynamic Elements Added:** Implemented CSS animations (), hover effects, and an animated number counter on the .
- **Branding and Content Updates:**
  - Renamed all Brackett Intelligence references to OSG Intelligence to credit a partner.
  - Added the tagline Solving your 3 AM problem to the  hero.
- **Icon Removal:** Removed decorative icons/emoticons from the  and .
- **Logo Integration:** Updated the  and  to use background-free SVG logos and increased their size.
- **Footer Redesign:** Fully restyled the  to match the new black and gold brand colors.
- **Layout Fixes:** Resolved an issue where the hero tagline could be scrolled out of view on tall screens.
- **Image Population:** Added hero images to every page.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, React Router
- **Styling:** A combination of global CSS (, ), Tailwind CSS utility classes, and custom CSS keyframe animations. Theming is managed via CSS variables.
- **Architecture:** Static multi-page application (MPA) structure built with client-side routing.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (The application is a static site with no database).

**changes in tech stack**
- N/A

**All files of reference**
- : Main stylesheet containing many global and component styles.
- : Defines CSS variables for the color theme.
- All files under : These were the files being edited when the application broke.
- : The site-wide footer component.
- : The site-wide navigation component.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The majority of the application's styling is centralized in . This makes it difficult to manage and debug. Refactoring styles into component-specific modules or files would significantly improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The application is completely broken.** Your first and only priority is to debug the blank-page rendering issue. Do not attempt any other task until the website is visible again.
- The error was introduced while attempting to apply a new color scheme across all pages simultaneously. The root cause is almost certainly a JavaScript error in the page components, likely from a faulty  operation.
- Use the browser console log as your primary debugging tool.
- After fixing the site, the next highest priority is delivering the Squarespace deployment instructions, which is a long-pending core requirement from the user.
