<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially wanted to create a cleaner, more business-oriented version of their agency website: .

This evolved into a comprehensive website restructuring based on a detailed guide provided by the user. The key requirements included:
- **PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - A complete overhaul of the website's architecture, navigation, and content.
    - New pages: Home, How We Work, Solutions, Brand & Design, Intelligence, Insights, About, Contact.
    - A new brand identity with the tagline: Intelligence That Executes.
    - Detailed content blueprints for each page, focusing on fractional strategic services, proprietary AI technology, and case studies.
    - A new design system with a black and gold color palette and Inter font.
    - The site should be populated with relevant, professional imagery.
    - The site must reflect that the agency serves both B2B and B2C clients.
    - The contact form should remain an external JotForm.
    - The Insights page should feature a blog where articles open on their own dedicated pages.
    - A core final deliverable is providing instructions on how to embed the React application into the user's Squarespace site.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A multi-page static React application has been built, featuring all user-requested pages, including a fully functional blog system on the Insights page with dynamic routing to individual article pages. The site uses a sophisticated black and gold theme, has been optimized for mobile, and has been updated to reflect a B2B and B2C client focus. However, the application is currently non-functional due to a syntax error introduced during the last task.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Expanding the content of a blog post titled From 0M to 0M: The Strategic Inflection Points. The agent introduced a JavaScript syntax error (improperly escaped backticks in a template literal) while editing the content, which is currently breaking the application.
-   **Status:** BLOCKED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** The agent must first fix the syntax error. Manual testing by viewing the file and then using  is required. After the fix, a screenshot of the specific blog post page () will be sufficient to verify the expanded content is rendering correctly.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Syntax Error in  (P0)**
    -   **Description:** The application is broken due to a syntax error in . An attempt to update blog content resulted in incorrectly escaped backticks () within a template literal string, causing a JavaScript parsing failure.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Details:**
        -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent made several failed attempts using  to fix the escaped backticks, indicating a misunderstanding of how to pass the correct string for replacement.
        -   **Next debug checklist:**
            1.  View the file  to confirm the exact location of the syntax error within the  field for the article with .
            2.  Use  or  to rewrite the content block, ensuring the template literal backticks are not escaped. The entire multiline string needs to be valid JavaScript.
        -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved?** This is a critical blocker. Fixing it will make the application runnable again and complete the user's request to expand the blog post content.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Blog Post Content Expansion (P0)**
    -   **Description:** The user requested more content for the blog post From 0M to 0M: The Strategic Inflection Points.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Where to resume:** This task is directly blocked by Issue 1. The agent must first fix the syntax error in . Once the fix is applied, this task will be considered complete.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The application will be functional, and the blog post will have the expanded content as requested by the user.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **Task 1: Provide Squarespace Deployment Instructions (P0):** This is a critical, unaddressed requirement from the original problem statement. The research has been completed and documented in , but the instructions need to be presented clearly to the user as a final deliverable.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **Task 2: Final Design Polish & Consistency Check (P1):** A full-site review to ensure consistent fonts, colors, spacing, and hover effects across all pages.
    - **Task 3: Enhance Contact Page (P2):** This page is functional but stylistically basic compared to others and could be enhanced to match the new design standard.
